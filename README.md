# Quantum Causal Algebra for Data Representation  
### A New Operator-Theoretic Framework Beyond Correlation

This repository contains the preprint **“Quantum Causal Algebra for Data Representation:  
A New Operator-Theoretic Framework Beyond Correlation”**, which introduces a new mathematical foundation for machine learning based on **quantum causal influence** rather than classical statistical correlation.

The work proposes three key theoretical objects:

- **Quantum Causal Matrix (QCM):**  
  A Hermitian operator encoding causal interactions derived from quantum process matrices, entanglement, and indefinite causal order.

- **Quantum Causal Tensor (QCT):**  
  A multilinear generalization capturing higher-order causal influence among multiple variables.

- **Quantum Causal PCA (QC-PCA):**  
  A spectral method that identifies principal directions of *quantum causal influence* in a Hilbert space, generalizing classical PCA.

This framework unifies causal inference, operator theory, tensor algebra, and quantum information science into a new class of **causal representation learning**.

## 🧠 Abstract

Machine learning traditionally relies on covariance and correlation matrices as the basis for representation learning.  
However, classical causality is inherently directional and incompatible with symmetric spectral methods such as PCA.

This work introduces the **Quantum Causal Matrix (QCM)**, a Hermitian operator constructed from quantum causal influence—leveraging entanglement, process matrices, and indefinite causal order.  
We generalize pairwise causal influence to a multilinear structure via the **Quantum Causal Tensor (QCT)** and develop **Quantum Causal PCA (QC-PCA)** as an operator-theoretic extension of PCA capable of capturing both classical and quantum causal dependencies.

The resulting framework provides a geometric, algebraic, and spectral foundation for causal representation learning beyond classical correlation.
